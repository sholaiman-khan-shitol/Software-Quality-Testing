# Software-Quality-Testing
This is a project for software quality assurance testing.
This project has four participants. We tested one of our own projects (PHP, HTML, and JS) that we completed earlier in the semester. Everyone has done their fair share. I completed one automation test using Selenium IDE. In addition, four manual testing were tested. Without it, I would have done acceptance testing (beta testing) by taking some of my friends' feedback.
